# Drawing-conclusions-using-Propositional-Logic

This project revolves around understanding Propositional Logic and how computers can help draw conclusions.

The program can draw conclusions for both CNF Clauses and Horn Clauses. The files CNF_KB and Horn_KB contain our database, whereas CNF_pr and Horn_pr contain the thing we want to prove. All of the previously mentioned files are in Json format.
